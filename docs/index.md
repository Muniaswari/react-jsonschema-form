react-jsonschema-form
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form)

A simple [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) component capable of building HTML forms out of a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) and using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) semantics by default.

A [live playground](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/) is hosted on gh-pages.

## Styling your forms

This library renders form fields and widgets leveraging the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) semantics. That means your forms will be beautiful by default if you're loading its stylesheet in your page.

You're not necessarily forced to use Bootstrap; while it uses its semantics, it also provides a bunch of other class names so you can bring new styles or override default ones quite easily in your own personalized stylesheet. That's just HTML after allÂ :)

If you're okay with using styles from the Bootstrap ecosystem though, then the good news is that you have access to many themes for it, which are compatible with our generated forms!

Here are some examples from the [playground](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/), using some of the [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) free themes:

Last, if you really really want to override the semantics generated by the lib, you can always create and use your own custom [widget](advanced-customization.md#custom-widget-components), [field](advanced-customization.md#custom-field-components) and/or [schema field](advanced-customization.md#custom-schemafield) components.
